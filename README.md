## Program Goals
"Youâ€™re a growth analyst at Mercado LibreLinks to an external site.. With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

The instructions for this Challenge are divided into four steps, as follows:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet." 

(BootcampSpot Module 8 Challenge Overview)

## Dependencies
Prophet Library, Pandas Library, Datetime Library, Numpy Library

## Setup Instructions
Run pip install Prophet, Pandas, Datetime, and Numpy before running program (if you do not already have these libraries).

## How to use
Run each jupyter notebook cell. That's pretty much it.

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this project:

## Bugs
When I had to calcluate the monthly median search traffic across all months in Part 1, it kept showing the average of monthly medians of every year rather than one value for the monthly median. To circumvent this, I took an average of the yearly medians.

Step 3 already had all the answers filled in to the open-ended questions, so I deleted those and replaced them with answers which reflect my own observations of the data.

## Update Log
1/1/2024: Created github repo. Modified README.md template in accordance with the feedback I recieved on my Module 6 challenge. Finished Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3. Pushed changes to github. Will finish this project tomorrow.
